The paper [Study protocol: combined N-of-1 trials to assess open-label placebo treatment for antidepressant discontinuation symptoms [FAB-study]](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05184-y)\\nwas published in cooperation with [Universit\xe4tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf](https://www.hsu-hh.de/) and [Universit\xe4tsklinikum Giessen und Marburg](https://www.ukgm.de),\\nboth of them based in Germany.\\n\\nLet us have a deeper look into the content of this innovative study and what this achievement means for StudyU.\\n\\n## Unlocking the Power of N-of-1 Trials with StudyU\\n\\n**StudyU** is a novel platform leading the way in the digital transformation of N-of-1 trials, the gold standard for\\nassessing personalized treatments. N-of-1 trials compare two interventions for each participant to identify the most\\neffective one. Comprising the **StudyU Designer** for specifying and publishing trials and the **StudyU App** for\\nparticipant engagement, the StudyU platform empowers clinicians and researchers globally to conduct secure digital\\nN-of-1 trials. **StudyU** envisions a future of more accessible and collaborative personalized treatments, available as\\na free research tool and a versatile resource for clinical practice.\\n\\n## Addressing the Antidepressant Discontinuation Challenge\\n\\nAntidepressant discontinuation is a complex issue, with many individuals facing adverse effects and symptoms that hinder\\nthe process of stopping medication. This can result in unnecessary, long-term use of antidepressants. The FAB-Study\\nacknowledges this challenge and proposes a solution around the concept of N-of-1 trials, which involves individual\\npatients using the **StudyU App** to provide personalized insights into their treatment.\\n\\n## The FAB-Study: A Closer Look\\n\\nThe FAB-Study involves conducting a series of randomized, single-blinded N-of-1 trials. In total, 20 patients with fully\\nremitted DSM-V major depressive disorder, who are experiencing moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms after\\nstopping antidepressants, participate in the study.\\n\\nEach N-of-1 trial consists of two cycles, each spanning eight weeks. Within these cycles, patients experience two-week\\nalternating periods of open-label placebo (OLP) treatment and no treatment, in a randomized order. Their self-reported\\ndiscontinuation symptoms are captured twice daily via our smartphone application, **StudyU**. Additionally, the study\\ntracks their expectations about discontinuation symptoms and mood states.\\n\\nMore information about the study is available in the open access paper: [Study protocol: combined N-of-1 trials to assess open-label placebo treatment for antidepressant discontinuation symptoms [FAB-study]](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05184-y)\\n\\n## How StudyU supported the FAB-Study\\n\\nFor the successful execution of a digital N-of-1 study, supportive and patient-friendly tools are essential. Due to the\\nunique nature of N-of-1 trials and their special requirements, the N-of-trial tailored platform **StudyU** served as a\\nparticularly helpful instrument during the implementation of the FAB-Study:\\n\\n\\"The new StudyU platform greatly supported the FAB-Study, by serving as an easy-to-use and cost-effective therapeutic\\ntool for us. Working with StudyU proved to be a pleasant experience for both the researchers and our patients. We will\\ndefinitely consider using StudyU for future N-of-1 studies\\", said study author Amke M\xfcller.\\n\\n## Promising Potential\\n\\nThe results of the FAB-Study may provide valuable insights into the clinical use of open-label placebos for treating\\nantidepressant discontinuation symptoms. Furthermore, the study not only addresses the clinical challenge at hand but\\nalso investigates the feasibility and applicability of a series of N-of-1 trials in a clinical discontinuation trial. \\nSuch insights could pave the way for more personalized, patient-centric treatments.\\n\\nAs N-of-1 studies become more widespread, digital N-of-1 platforms could play a vital role in the future in supporting\\npersonalized healthcare. They provide the infrastructure needed to streamline the trial process, from specifying \\ninterventions to real-time data collection and analysis. In addition, digital N-of-1 platforms play a key role in the\\nadoption of N-of-1 studies, as traditional analog methods had limitations in their implementation.\\n\\nWith digital platforms, such as **StudyU**, trials can be conducted remotely or via smartphones, enhancing participant \\nengagement and ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data. The scalability and efficiency they offer make N-of-1\\ntrials more accessible and practical for personalized treatment assessment, holding great promise for the future of\\nhealthcare.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs the developers of the **StudyU** platform, we are pleased to see **StudyU** being actively used in health research.\\nIt makes us proud to see how **StudyU** contributes to an important research topic in the field of antidepressant\\ndiscontinuation. The FAB study is an example of the potential of personalized medicine and the central role **StudyU**\\ncan play in this area.\\n\\nFor us, the paper represents a significant step toward enhancing healthcare and improving the lives of patients. We are\\nexcited about the future and the possibilities that personalized healthcare, powered by technologies like **StudyU**, holds."},{"id":"federal-health-minister-meets-studyu","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/blog/federal-health-minister-meets-studyu","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-8-presentation-to-health-minister.mdx","title":"Introducing StudyU to the German Federal Minister of Health","description":"On June 8, 2023, we had the honor of introducing StudyU to Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach,","date":"2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"8.
