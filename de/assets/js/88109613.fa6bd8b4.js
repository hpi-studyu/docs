In\r\nphysicians' case, however, high stress levels have also been identified as a\r\nreason for suboptimal quality of medical care. This includes deviations from\r\nstandard procedures, a decrease in the quality of the doctor-patient\r\nrelationship, and treatment errors.

Therefore, a randomized study design is needed to account for all\r\nknown and unknown confounders. While randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)\r\nare often used to assess the effects of interventions, this might not be the\r\nideal design for anti-stress interventions. Firstly, RCTs focus on the outcome\r\neffect on the group level but neglect intra-individual effects. However, for an\r\nanti-stress intervention, it is much more interesting to analyze the effects of\r\nthe intervention within the individual (which can differ from between-group\r\neffects). Additionally, population-level effects can subsequently be estimated\r\nfrom the data collected in the N-of-1 trial as well, thereby ensuring no\r\ninsights are lost. Secondly, due to the repeated measurements in an N-of-1\r\ntrial, temporal changes can be analyzed. Thirdly, owing to advanced applications\r\nlike StudyU, the interventions can be applied, and the outcomes\r\nmeasured, in the context of daily life. Due to these (and additional)\r\nadvantages, N-of-1 trials are "regarded [to be] at the top of the evidence\r\nhierarchy [...] over and above systematic reviews of RCTs" (Kwasnicka et al.,\r\n2019) for individual treatment choices.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"digital-application-of-intervention-through-studyu",children:"Digital Application of Intervention through StudyU"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The StudyU platform contributes to the ASIP Study by providing a user-friendly\r\ninterface that manages and applies the intervention (through audio/video files)\r\nand collects the participant-reported outcome measures.
