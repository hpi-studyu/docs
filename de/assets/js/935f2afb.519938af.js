However, the analysis of such large population-based studies only gives insights into factors affecting diseases and treatments on average. Hence, these results do not allow meaningful predictions whether an intervention will help a given single individual. For example, major drugs in therapeutic areas including asthma, depression, diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis have only shown an efficacy in 50%-60% of patients. Similarly, the effect of health interventions and lifestyle changes on chronic disease and health outcomes on an individual level if often unclear.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"basics/studyu-platform":{"id":"basics/studyu-platform","title":"The StudyU Platform","description":"The StudyU platform contains the StudyU Designer and the StudyU App, which allow to design and implement, and then to conduct the study, respectively.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"basics/team":{"id":"basics/team","title":"Team","description":"See StudyU at HPI.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"designer/howto-designer":{"id":"designer/howto-designer","title":"How to use the StudyU Designer","description":"The StudyU designer is divided into two main components, the dashboard and the editor.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"designer/overview":{"id":"designer/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Designer Lifecycle","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/selfhosting":{"id":"development/selfhosting","title":"Selfhosting","description":"StudyU can be self hosted by using Docker.
