Here, we\npresent the StudyU platform which includes the StudyU designer and StudyU app. With the StudyU\ndesigner, scientists are given a web application to digitally specify, publish, and conduct N-of-1\ntrials. The StudyU app is a smartphone application with innovative user-centric elements for\nparticipants to partake in the published trials and assess the effects of different interventions on\ntheir health. Thereby, the StudyU platform allows clinicians and researchers worldwide to easily\ndesign and conduct digital N-of-1 trials in a safe manner.
