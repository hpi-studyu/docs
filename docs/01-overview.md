> A platform for designing, monitoring and analyzing N-of-1 trials, shaping the future of personalized medicine

N-of-1 trials are the gold standard study design to evaluate individual treatment effects and derive personalized treatment strategies. Digital tools have the potential to initiate a new era of N-of-1 trials in terms of scale and scope, but fully-functional platforms are not yet available. Here, we present the StudyU platform which includes the StudyU designer and StudyU app. With the StudyU designer, scientists are given a web application to digitally specify, publish, and conduct N-of-1 trials. The StudyU app is a smartphone application with innovative user-centric elements for participants to partake in the published trials and assess the effects of different interventions on their health. Thereby, the StudyU platform allows clinicians and researchers worldwide to easily design and conduct digital N-of-1 trials in a safe manner. We envision that StudyU can change the landscape of personalized treatments both for patients and healthy individuals, as a free collaborative tool for researchers, and as a tool that can be integrated in clinical practice.

StudyU was initiated in Master project in summer 2020: “App-based N-of-1 trials in a clinically-relevant context for personalizing digital health interventions”. Further development is done in different projects, Master theses, collaborations, and in the ongoing Master project in Summer 2022 "Adaptive digital N-of-1 trials for personalizing digital health interventions". 

This project is embedded in different project on N-of-1 trials and digital health interventions, see here for more details.
