# StudyU Self-Hosting

The following guide describes the necessary steps in order to deploy a self-hosted instance
of StudyU. In case you just want to use StudyU, read on at [The StudyU Platform](/docs/basics/studyu-platform).

## Component Overview

The StudyU application consists of the StudyU App and the StudyU Designer. The StudyU App
allows participants to take part in N-of-1 trials created with the StudyU Designer.
The StudyU App is available for Apple and Android smartphones, and also as a web application.
The StudyU Designer is only available as a web-application and enables clinicians to design
and conduct N-of-1 trials.

All application data is handled by Supabase which serves as a middleware framework between
a Postgres database and the StudyU components. Supabase is a self-hosted alternative to
Firebase and provides API, authentication, and storage functionality. It is coupled with a
PostgreSQL database that stores all of StudyU’s data. The data is stored persistent can and
on-premise inside a docker volume.

The connection between the user's device and Supabase is established directly between the
user client and the Supabase reverse proxy. The reverse proxy maps the different Supabase
components to a single port which simplifies self-hosting.

## Security

Access to all components requires authentication. This is done via the Supabase JWT implementation.
Users of the StudyU Designer have to register an account (email and password) on first use and
login before they can use the system. For the StudyU App, anonymous accounts are created
automatically on first use and stored persistently on the user’s device. User accounts are managed
together with the StudyU data on the local Supabase instance and do not reside elsewhere.
Furthermore, access to all created data, including studies and participant data, is protected by
Supabase policies. This ensures that no unauthorized access to the data is permitted.

## System Requirements

The StudyU and Supabase setup runs with Docker and Docker compose. Therefore, every system that
supports the Docker Engine, will be sufficient (Linux, Windows, macOS, or other UNIX-like systems).
Running the system on AWS with ECS should in general be possible, however, this has yet to be verified.
For a simple setup with a restricted number of users, we recommend the following system requirements:

Essential:
-	VM with 4 core CPU and 16 GB RAM
-	Docker installation

Optional:
-	Internet access, e.g. via reverse proxy with forwarded ports, including SSH for maintenance and HTTP or HTTPS
-	SSL Certificates
-	Regular Backup capabilities for Supabase (cronjob, etc.)

## Get Started

We have developed a StudyU CLI to help you setting up StudyU easily. The process is described in the `docker`
directory on the [StudyU GitHub](https://github.com/hpi-studyu/studyu/blob/dev/docker/README.md)
