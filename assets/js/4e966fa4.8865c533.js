Therefore, a randomized study design is needed to account for all\nknown and unknown confounders. While randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)\nare often used to assess the effects of interventions, this might not be the\nideal design for anti-stress interventions. Firstly, RCTs focus on the outcome\neffect on the group level but neglect intra-individual effects. However, for an\nanti-stress intervention, it is much more interesting to analyze the effects of\nthe intervention within the individual (which can differ from between-group\neffects). Additionally, population-level effects can subsequently be estimated\nfrom the data collected in the N-of-1 trial as well, thereby ensuring no\ninsights are lost. Secondly, due to the repeated measurements in an N-of-1\ntrial, temporal changes can be analyzed. Thirdly, owing to advanced applications\nlike StudyU, the interventions can be applied, and the outcomes\nmeasured, in the context of daily life.
