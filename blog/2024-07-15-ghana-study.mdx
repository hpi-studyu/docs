The study, titled "Enhancing Digital N-of-1 Trial: A Comprehensive Exploration of User and Clinician
Engagement, Motivations, and Experiences in Ghana Using the StudyMe and StudyU Apps," focuses on
exploring how digital tools can be used to design personalized trials.
<!-- truncate --> Clinicians use StudyU to design these trials, capturing valuable data on
feasibility and design challenges in low-resource settings like Ghana. We believe this addresses
critical gaps in the personalized medicine landscape in Ghana. We seek to suggest refinements,
enhancements and functionality of the [StudyMe and StudyU](https://hpi.de/lippert/projects/studyu.html)
applications, improving user experiences across diverse geographical and technological contexts.

## Role of StudyU and StudyMe in the project
StudyU is utilized by clinicians to design trials without implementing them, gathering insights into
the trial design process under the constraints typical in Ghana. StudyMe is used by the general
public, who design and implement trials, providing real-world feedback on the applicability and
effectiveness of these personalized approaches.

## Insights and impact
This study is pivotal in understanding how digital tools like StudyU and StudyMe can be optimized
for use in diverse environments, particularly in settings that face significant resource
constraints. The insights from this study will guide enhancements to both apps, making them more
adaptable and user-friendly for clinicians and patients in developing regions.

## Study team
Supervision: Dr. Stefan Konigorski and spearheaded by Godsway Sackey;
[Health Intervention Analytics Lab](https://hpi.de/lippert/senior-researcher-labs/health-intervention-analytics-lab.html)
of the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Germany.

Collaborators: Prof. Frank Baiden and others from the [School of Public Health, UHAS, Ghana](https://www.uhas.edu.gh/).

Participants: The study includes 300 individuals from the public across sixteen regions in Ghana and
approximately 20 physicians in six regions. The study engages clinicians using the StudyU App to
design N-of-1 trials, and participants from the general public who will use the StudyMe App for
personal trials.
