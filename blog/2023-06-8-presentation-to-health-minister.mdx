During his visit to the Digital Health Cluster of the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) on June 8, 2023, 
we had the privilege of introducing StudyU to the German Federal Minister of Health,
Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach. The Prime Minister of Health was already aware about the potential of N-of-1 trials 
and how they can provide personalized insights into treatment effectiveness. Through his visit, 
Prof. Dr. Lauterbach was able to gain firsthand knowledge about how StudyU offers an empowering opportunity 
to develop individualized care plans and enhance patient outcomes.

We want to thank Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach for taking his time to visit the Digital Health Cluster at HPI
to learn more about StudyU and other ongoing digital health research projects.
