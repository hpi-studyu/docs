On June 8, 2023, we had the honor of introducing StudyU to Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach,
the German Federal Minister of Health, during his visit to the Digital Health Cluster at the
Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI). In a engaging discussion with senior researcher Dr. Stefan Konigorski,
the minister was able to gain firsthand knowledge about how StudyU offers an empowering opportunity
to develop individualized care plans and enhance patient outcomes.

Prof. Lauterbach was already aware of how N-of-1 trials have the potential to provide personalized
insights into treatment effectiveness. However, he was impressed to learn that StudyU enables the
digital conduction of these trials, making them more accessible and convenient. The digital implementation
of N-of-1 trials through StudyU left a lasting positive impression on him, emphasizing the platform's
capability to advance personalized healthcare research.

We want to thank Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach for taking his time to visit the Digital Health Cluster at HPI
to learn more about StudyU and other ongoing digital health research projects.
