<!-- truncate --> The symposium was organized by the Heidelberg University Hospital and the Heidelberg Institute for
Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology and took place in the Marsilius Arkaden of the
University of Heidelberg.

The symposium was attended by a diverse audience of medical informatics experts, clinicians, and
researchers. The StudyU platform was presented as a novel tool for designing, monitoring, and
analyzing N-of-1 trials. The presentation highlighted the potential of the StudyU platform to
revolutionize personalized medicine by enabling researchers to conduct large-scale N-of-1 trials
digitally. Furthermore, [current collaborations and ongoing projects](http://localhost:3000/docs/basics/studies)
utilizing the StudyU platform in various clinical settings were discussed, showcasing the platform's
versatility and applicability in different research domains and international contexts.

The presentation was well-received by the audience, who expressed interest in the platform's
capabilities and potential applications. Several attendees approached Johannes Vedder after the
presentation to inquire about the platform and discuss potential collaborations.

Overall, the 2nd Heidelberg Spring Symposium on Medical Informatics was a successful event that
provided an excellent platform for showcasing the StudyU platform and engaging with the medical
informatics community. The positive feedback received at the symposium further validates the
importance and relevance of the StudyU platform in the field of personalized medicine. We look forward
