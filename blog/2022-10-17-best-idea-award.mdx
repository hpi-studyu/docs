StudyU has won the <b>Best Idea Award 2022</b> of the School Of Entrepreneurship at Hasso Plattner
Institute (HPI).

Winning this award grants us the opportunity to <b>visit HPI New York City</b> and meet its director,
Dr. Joann Halpern. Additionally, it enables us to establish connections with HPIï½¥MS, a collaborative
project between HPI and [Mount Sinai Health System](https://www.mountsinai.org/), renowned as one of the world's top-ranked hospitals.

With these new possibilities, our goal is to further enhance the development of StudyU, so that a
greater number of individuals will be able to experience the advantages of personalized healthcare interventions.

Many thanks to everyone who voted for us!
