StudyU has won the <b>Best Idea Award 2022</b> of the School Of Entrepreneurship at Hasso Plattner
Institute (HPI). The team consists of Pauline Gieseler and Johannes Vedder, who are both
students at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.

Winning this award grants us the opportunity to <b>visit HPI New York City</b> and meet its director,
Dr. Joann Halpern. Additionally, it enables us to establish connections with HPIï½¥MS, a collaborative
project between HPI and [Mount Sinai Health System](https://www.mountsinai.org/), renowned as one
of the world's top-ranked hospitals.

With these new possibilities, our goal is to further enhance the development of StudyU, so that a
greater number of individuals will be able to experience the advantages of personalized healthcare
interventions.

Many thanks to everyone who voted for us!
