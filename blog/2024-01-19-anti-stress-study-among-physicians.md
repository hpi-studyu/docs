title: Innovative Anti-Stress Study among Physicians at Charité
---

The "Anti-Stress Intervention Among Physicians (ASIP)" Study utilizes
StudyU to investigate the following intriguing and pertinent research 
question:

>How can the everyday level of perceived stress be reduced in a fast and
>easy-to-implement manner?

The project will be conducted in cooperation with the [Institute for Public
Health at Charité](https://iph.charite.de/en/) – Universitätsmedizin Berlin
(Principal Investigator: Dr. med. Valentin Vetter).

## Background

Physicians in Germany generally experience a high level of psychosocial stress.
This holds true for those working in hospitals, general practitioners, and
physicians in outpatient clinics. It is a well-known fact that high levels of
stress negatively impact the physical and mental health of individuals. In
physicians' case, however, high stress levels have also been identified as a
reason for suboptimal quality of medical care. This includes deviations from
standard procedures, a decrease in the quality of the doctor-patient
relationship, and treatment errors. Potentially substantial structural changes
in the organization and management of health care as well as in the way
physicians are compensated by health insurers would be required to achieve
sustainable improvements for medical personnel. Hence, a more immediate and
easy-to-implement solution to reduce perceived stress is needed.

## The Intervention

An intervention to improve the stress level of physicians must meet certain
criteria to increase the likelihood of being implemented in everyday life and
leading to sustainable improvements. First, the intervention needs to be easy to
learn and brief, as time is often limited during a busy workday. Second, the
intervention should be conducted without additional tools. Third, the
intervention needs to be successful in reducing stress. All the criteria listed
above are fulfilled by two techniques that have been intensively studied over
the past decades: breathwork and mindfulness-based meditation techniques.

## Why Use an N-of-1 Design

Perception of stress is highly individual and dependent on a large number of
variables, both known and unknown, which are partly hard to measure accurately.
The same is potentially true for the effect of an anti-stress intervention on
stress levels. Therefore, a randomized study design is needed to account for all
known and unknown confounders. While randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)
are often used to assess the effects of interventions, this might not be the
ideal design for anti-stress interventions. Firstly, RCTs focus on the outcome
effect on the group level but neglect intra-individual effects. However, for an
anti-stress intervention, it is much more interesting to analyze the effects of
the intervention within the individual (which can differ from between-group
effects). Additionally, population-level effects can subsequently be estimated
from the data collected in the N-of-1 trial as well, thereby ensuring no
insights are lost. Secondly, due to the repeated measurements in an N-of-1
trial, temporal changes can be analyzed. Thirdly, owing to advanced applications
like StudyU, the interventions can be applied, and the outcomes
measured, in the context of daily life. Due to these (and additional)
advantages, N-of-1 trials are "regarded [to be] at the top of the evidence
hierarchy [...] over and above systematic reviews of RCTs" (Kwasnicka et al.,
2019) for individual treatment choices.

## Digital Application of Intervention through StudyU

The StudyU platform contributes to the ASIP Study by providing a user-friendly
interface that manages and applies the intervention (through audio/video files)
and collects the participant-reported outcome measures. The application will
ensure good adherence to the study protocol by presenting the current phase of
the trial in a structured and clear way, as well as through push notifications.
