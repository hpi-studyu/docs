title: StudyU's Role in Easing Antidepressant Discontinuation in the FAB-Study
---

We are pleased to announce the publication of the first research paper utilizing the StudyU platform
for a medical study. The paper [Study protocol: combined N-of-1 trials to assess open-label placebo treatment for antidepressant discontinuation symptoms [FAB-study]](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05184-y)
was published in cooperation with [Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf](https://www.hsu-hh.de/) and [Universitätsklinikum Giessen und Marburg](https://www.ukgm.de),
both of them based in Germany.

Let us have a deeper look into the content of this innovative study and what this achievement means for StudyU.

## Unlocking the Power of N-of-1 Trials with StudyU

**StudyU** is a novel platform leading the way in the digital transformation of N-of-1 trials, the gold standard for
assessing personalized treatments. N-of-1 trials compare two interventions for each participant to identify the most
effective one. Comprising the **StudyU Designer** for specifying and publishing trials and the **StudyU App** for
participant engagement, the StudyU platform empowers clinicians and researchers globally to conduct secure digital
N-of-1 trials. **StudyU** envisions a future of more accessible and collaborative personalized treatments, available as
a free research tool and a versatile resource for clinical practice.

## Addressing the Antidepressant Discontinuation Challenge

Antidepressant discontinuation is a complex issue, with many individuals facing adverse effects and symptoms that hinder
the process of stopping medication. This can result in unnecessary, long-term use of antidepressants. The FAB-Study
acknowledges this challenge and proposes a solution around the concept of N-of-1 trials, which involves individual
patients using the **StudyU App** to provide personalized insights into their treatment.

## The FAB-Study: A Closer Look

The FAB-Study involves conducting a series of randomized, single-blinded N-of-1 trials. In total, 20 patients with fully
remitted DSM-V major depressive disorder, who are experiencing moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms after
stopping antidepressants, participate in the study.

Each N-of-1 trial consists of two cycles, each spanning eight weeks. Within these cycles, patients experience two-week
alternating periods of open-label placebo (OLP) treatment and no treatment, in a randomized order. Their self-reported
discontinuation symptoms are captured twice daily via our smartphone application, **StudyU**. Additionally, the study
tracks their expectations about discontinuation symptoms and mood states.

More information about the study is available in the open access paper: [Study protocol: combined N-of-1 trials to assess open-label placebo treatment for antidepressant discontinuation symptoms [FAB-study]](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05184-y)

## How StudyU supported the FAB-Study

For the successful execution of a digital N-of-1 study, supportive and patient-friendly tools are essential. Due to the
unique nature of N-of-1 trials and their special requirements, the N-of-trial tailored platform **StudyU** served as a
particularly helpful instrument during the implementation of the FAB-Study:

"The new StudyU platform greatly supported the FAB-Study, by serving as an easy-to-use and cost-effective therapeutic
tool for us. Working with StudyU proved to be a pleasant experience for both the researchers and our patients. We will
definitely consider using StudyU for future N-of-1 studies", said study author Amke Müller.

## Promising Potential

The results of the FAB-Study may provide valuable insights into the clinical use of open-label placebos for treating
antidepressant discontinuation symptoms. Furthermore, the study not only addresses the clinical challenge at hand but
also investigates the feasibility and applicability of a series of N-of-1 trials in a clinical discontinuation trial. 
Such insights could pave the way for more personalized, patient-centric treatments.

As N-of-1 studies become more widespread, digital N-of-1 platforms could play a vital role in the future in supporting
personalized healthcare. They provide the infrastructure needed to streamline the trial process, from specifying 
interventions to real-time data collection and analysis. In addition, digital N-of-1 platforms play a key role in the
adoption of N-of-1 studies, as traditional analog methods had limitations in their implementation.

With digital platforms, such as **StudyU**, trials can be conducted remotely or via smartphones, enhancing participant 
engagement and ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data. The scalability and efficiency they offer make N-of-1
trials more accessible and practical for personalized treatment assessment, holding great promise for the future of
healthcare.

## Conclusion

As the developers of the **StudyU** platform, we are pleased to see **StudyU** being actively used in health research.
It makes us proud to see how **StudyU** contributes to an important research topic in the field of antidepressant
discontinuation. The FAB study is an example of the potential of personalized medicine and the central role **StudyU**
can play in this area.

For us, the paper represents a significant step toward enhancing healthcare and improving the lives of patients. We are
excited about the future and the possibilities that personalized healthcare, powered by technologies like **StudyU**, holds.
